# Fine Tune Your Day

## Description
Fine Tune Your Day is the ultimate day planner. It is designed for music lovers to organize their day by accompanying their tasks with relevant playlists. This solves the problem of lost time choosing music throughout your day. Fine Tune Your Day optimizes this with the use of Spotify's API. Users can also plan their day according to the weather with OpenWeather's weather API. This project taught us how to collaborate on GitHub and delegate tasks. We learned how to incorporate third-party APIs and how to integrate everyone's code.

## Installation

Click the 'Add Task' button to bring up a form where you select your task and the desired time. Once you hit submit, the application will provide you with three Spotify playlists relevant to your task. Add as many tasks as you want, and use the 'x' button to remove completed tasks.
